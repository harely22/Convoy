# Convoy2
This project measures the fairness and efficiency of a single Sequential Online Chore Division (SOCD) game,
and how close the Single Game Mechanism (SG) is to perfect efficiency (ex-post proportionality) compared to the Repeated Game Mechanism (RG).
It is built on top of project "Convoy1" which was made for the repeated game scenario - so some things are redundant.
Test2 is the main file that contains all of the definitions and runs the simulation.
It prints the statistics to the console, specifically the Gini scores for the single game mechanism and the repeated game mechanism.
